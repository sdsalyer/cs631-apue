# Checklist

For each assignment, copy this file into your homework
submission directory and answer all questions.

Did I write all the code myself?
   - Don't copy and paste code from the internet, your
     classmates, sample solutions, or anywhere else.
     Review https://stevens.netmeister.org/631/#plagiarism

Did I use any AI technologies?  If so, did I properly
acknowledge this help?
   - Review https://stevens.netmeister.org/631/use-of-ai.html


Does my code follow the style guide?
   - Code is communication.  Make sure your code is
     readable, well-structured, properly indented,
     with sensibily named variables and functions.


Does my code compile without warnings or errors on a
NetBSD 10.0 system?
  - Always use *at least* 'cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra',
    possibly
    'cc -ansi -g -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wformat=2 -Wjump-misses-init -Wlogical-op -Wpedantic -Wshadow'.


Did I provide a Makefile?
  - 'make' should use the above CFLAGS and produce an
    executable


Did I provide a README to explain any problems or
issues I encountered?
  - Make sure that your text is well-formatted, plain
    ASCII in proper English.  Use a spell checker.


Did I check the return value of all function calls?
  - Yes, that does include but is not limited to malloc(3).


Did I send error messages to stderr?  Did I use
strerror(3) or perror(3) etc. to print meaningful
error messages?


Did I use only meaningful and necessary comments?
  - Your comments should explain the 'why', not the
    'what'.

Does my program only generate meaningful output?
Debugging information should be removed.  Remember to
remove all dead code and debugging statements.


Does my program return zero on success, non-zero otherwise?


Did I make sure that my .h files only include function
forward declarations, macros, etc., no function
implementations or other code?


Did I check that I have avoided code duplication?
Writing the same or very similar code multiple times
is a sign that my program could benefit from being
restructured.


For any string manipulation, did I use size-bounded
functions?
  - Use strlcat(3)/strlcpy(3) instead of
    strcat(3)/strcpy(3) etc.
